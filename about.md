     <p>I am the Founder of <a href="https://trysparrow.com">Sparrow</a>, software that makes it easier for companies to provide their employees with leave (e.g. family, disability, medical, etc.). By alleviating administrative overhead, we save companies time, money (up to 70% of an employee's salary), and prevent employee churn. I use this blog as a time saving device. If I spend  an hour (or more) advising or training someone, I turn my thoughts into a blog post. I hope you find it useful.</a>

     <p>Previously, I was a PhD student at <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu">Harvard</a>. As an NSF Fellow, I studied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a> while advised by <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/finale">Finale Doshi</a> and <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/rpa">Ryan Adams</a>.</p>

     <p>I graduated from MIT with a M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and a double-Bachelor's in Computer Science and Brain & Cognitive Sciences. As a Master's student, I worked with <a href="https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/dw87">David Wingate</a>, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> to schedule <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computer_science%29">process threads</a> on Tilera, a multicore chip.  As an undergraduate, I worked with <a href="http://www.edvul.com">Ed Vul</a> in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml"> Kanwisher Lab</a> on a variety of projects, publishing several papers focused on uncertainty and visual attention. In the intervening time, I've worked as a software engineer and a <a href="http://www.iie.org/fulbright">Fulbright Scholar</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, learning how education can translate to job creation.</p>
