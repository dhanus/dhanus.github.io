     <p>I am the Founder & CEO  of <a href="https://trysparrow.com">Sparrow</a>, software that makes it simple for companies to provide their employees with leave (i.e. family leave). I use this blog as a time saving device. If I spend  an hour (or more) advising or training someone, I turn my thoughts into a blog post. I hope you find it useful.</p>

     <p>I graduated from MIT with a M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and a double-Bachelor's in Computer Science and Brain & Cognitive Sciences, and I left a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>  PhD at <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard<a>.  I've worked as a software engineer, and I've done research as a  <a href="http://www.iie.org/fulbright">Fulbright Scholar</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia">Cambodia</a>.</p>
