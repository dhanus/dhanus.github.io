      <p>I study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a> at <a href="http://www.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> as an NSF Fellow working with <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/finale">Finale Doshi</a> and <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/rpa">Ryan Adams</a>. I enjoy working on projects in the intersection of software, machine learning, and behavior.</p>

      <p>I graduated from MIT with a M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science and a double-Bachelor's in Computer Science and Brain & Cognitive Sciences. As a Master's student, I worked with <a href="https://cs.byu.edu/faculty/dw87">David Wingate</a>, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> to schedule <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computer_science%29">process threads</a> on Tilera, a multicore chip.  As an undergraduate, I worked with <a href="http://www.edvul.com">Ed Vul</a> in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/nklab/index.shtml"> Kanwisher Lab</a> on a variety of projects, publishing several papers focused on uncertainty and visual attention. In the intervening time, I've worked as an early software engineer at a startup company and as a <a href="http://www.iie.org/fulbright">Fulbright Scholar</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, learning how education can translate to job creation.</p>
      
      <p>I use this blog as a time saving device. If I spend  an hour (or more) advising or training someone on a given topic, I write a blog post. I hope you find it useful.</p>
