     <p>I speak about how to do things in software, and sometimes these talks are recorded. I've also spoken at the Boston Python Meetup, <a href="https://twitter.com/pytennessee">PyTennessee</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/WithTheBest">AI With the Best</a>. If you would like me to speak at your event, please send me an email.</p>
