<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ast year, I read almost all of the books I read early in the year when I was unemployed. By the end of the year, I was finding it a bit difficult to read as much as I wanted - so this year, I full embraced audiobooks, which have helped me to read more despite the fact that I actually have less time than I did last year.</p>

## Sales 

I spent most of 2019 as Sparrow's only sales person, and even now as the year comes to a close, I'd say that sales is still probably at least 60% of my job. These are some of the books that I've read this year. 

**[Fanatical Prospecting](https://amzn.to/2OmZjQb)** by Jeb Blount

To continuously close sales, you need to continuously keep the top of your sales funnel full. This was a great compilation of concrete suggestions to make it happen. I highly recommend this book to anyone getting started in sales. 

**[Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805)** by Chris Voss 

This was a really nice compilations of tips to better understand the situation you are walking into and therefore, negotiate more effectively. 

**[Flip the Script](https://www.amazon.com/Flip-Script-Getting-People-Think/dp/052553394X)** by Oren Klaff

It's easier to talk to people when they see you as an expert in their field. This book shares a general framework to make people feel like you are one of them. 

**[The Like Switch](https://www.amazon.com/Like-Switch-Influencing-Attracting-Winning/dp/1476754489)** by Jack Schafer

It's easier to get people to talk to you when they like and trust you. This book shares some concrete tips to make this happen. 

**[Monetizing Innovation](https://amzn.to/2LCr09K)** by Madhavan Ramanujam & Georg Tacke 

I read this at someone's suggestion. I'd say that it is a good book, but it is written for someone who is still in the very early stages of determining pricing and product market fit. 

## Management 

**[The Making of a Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Manager-What-Everyone-Looks/dp/0735219567)** by Julie Zhuo

I really liked this book, because it is written by someone who became a manager early in their career, and thus, had to deal with a whole host of extra issues due to inexperience. It was really a nice balance of storytelling and advice. 

**[Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)** by James Clear

This was a really nice book that suggested concrete ways to form habits. 

## Scaling a Company 

**[High Growth Handbook](https://amzn.to/2WMd65K)** by Elad Gil

This is a really nice step-by-step of things to think about as a company is scaling. That said, I think it is best read as a hardcopy that you keep on a shelf and use as a reference manual. Listening to it as an audiobook at 1.5x speed was a bit brutal and not the best for retention. 

**[Blink](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316010669)** by Malcolm Gladwell

While this is not explicitly about scaling a company, I found that reading it while we were trying to scale was helpful to get me to trust my gut feelings a little bit more, which enabled me to make decisions faster. 

# Powerful Women

When I read most leadership books, they are written about (and for) men, so I'm always on the look out for books about powerful women. These were all great, but I especially enjoyed Becoming and Black Fortunes. 

**[Becoming](https://amzn.to/2OjV3B1)** by Michelle Obama 

**[The Hungry Ocean](https://www.amazon.com/The-Hungry-Ocean/dp/B001IV0EK6/)** by Linda Greenlaw

**[Black Fortunes](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Fortunes-African-Americans-Millionaires-ebook/dp/B07192GQWB)** by Shomari Wills

# Things to Think About

This year, I joined a book club, which got me to read all sorts of books that I normally would not read. I usually read exclusively non-fiction. But most of these were really thought-provoking books that I think expanded the way that I think and approach problems. 

**[The 5th Season](https://amzn.to/2NTYrSG)** by N.K. Jemisin

**[Passing](https://amzn.to/2XgD0iv)** by Nella Larsen

**[The Nickel Boys](https://www.amazon.com/Nickel-Boys-Novel-Colson-Whitehead/dp/0385537077)** by Colson Whitehead

**[Winners Take All](https://amzn.to/2NWm5OM)** by Anand Giridharadas

**[How To Be Successful Without Hurting Men's Feelings](https://amzn.to/2NRNRM6)** by Sarah Cooper

**[How To Be An Antiracist](https://www.amazon.com/How-to-Be-an-Antiracist/dp/B07TT85KLQ/)** by Ibrahim X. Kendi  

**[Ghettoside](https://www.amazon.com/Ghettoside-True-Story-Murder-America-ebook/dp/B0062OCN4E)** by Jill Leovy
