<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">P</span>artway through 2017, I realized that I had pretty much stopped reading books. This didn't seem like a particularly positive development, so I set a goal of reading for an hour per day. Some of the books were informative. Some were entertaining. While some were more engaging than others, all of them were good.</a>

# Phenomenally good books

Reading these books will make your life better. 

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815">Weapons of Math Destruction</a> by Cathy O'Neil

This is easy to read, but very clearly describes the problems associated with thinking of algorithms as "impartial". I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to easily understand some of the ways that well-intended  algorithms can go wrong.   

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Works-Gender-Equality-Design/dp/0674089030">What Works: Gender Equality by Design</a> by Iris Bohnet

This is a slow read that is probably easiest read in small sections. However, it is written by someone who has spent years studying gender inequality, and unlike most writing on the topic, which concludes something like "this is a hard problem", each chapter is packed with thoughtful, actionable insights that people can use to design systems and workplaces that encourage gender equality. 

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unlocking-Clubhouse-Women-Computing-Press/dp/0262632691">Unlocking the Clubhouse</a> by Jane Margolis & Allen Fisher

I actually first read this book before 2017, but it is so good that I had to include it. It is written by two professors, who tried to get to the bottom of why there are so few women in computer science. For me, reading this gave me a framework that allowed me to see a lot of the uncomfortable situations I sometimes experience as a symptom of a larger, fixable social problem.  

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Marshall-Rosenberg/dp/1892005034">Nonviolent Communication</a> by Marshall Rosenberg

This reads like a self-help book in that it has a few key ideas, and it gives more examples than necessary for you to understand the concept. That said, the ideas introduced if implemented can be absolutely life changing. The book tries to provide a framework for developing an understanding of what people are feeling and perceiving, rather than what they are saying. 

# Really good books 

If any of these books look interesting to you, you should read them, because you will almost certainly enjoy reading them. If they do not look interesting to you, you can probably still manage to be a functional human being without reading them.
